      <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
	<br><p>As the Perseverance Mars rover celebrated the first anniversary exploring the Red Planet early this year, we couldn’t help but feel the excitement and inspiration again this mission brought to many around the world in year 2021. A moment in time, for our next generation to fathom the infinite possibilities of the future through innovation in technology, creativity and curiosity of the mind and the perseverance of the human spirit. To be associated with a project of this nature - bringing the experience of the Perseverance Rover to students across Australia - will be a highlight for Young Engineers Canberra. Furthermore, to build a replica of the Perseverance Rover that will be displayed at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex through educating and engaging our student community in the ACT makes this project all the more significant.</p> 
	<br><p>This proposal outlines the different facets of this project, including the scope, deliverables, education program, community engagement, marketing and public relations plan, estimated budget, timelines and further recommendations for project continuation. In order to compile this project proposal, we have consulted many industry specialists, senior education professionals, suppliers, advertising and marketing specialists and other stakeholders who we can partner with for the project. In doing so we have been able to provide you with a comprehensive plan that to achieve the set deliverables.</p>
	<br><p>Young Engineers is one of the largest STEM education providers in Australia serving students since 2008. Our commitment to bring innovative learning solutions to the education sector to complement the STEM education of Australian schools drives us to seek and partner with industry specialists who can uplift our students’ knowledge and experience. We believe this is a fit for purpose STEM project that achieves many of the learning goals of the CDSCC, CSIRO and NASA which Young Engineers Canberra is highly capable of delivering.</p>

    <div id="OurCompany" class="page">
      <h1>Our Company</h1>
	<br><p>Young Engineers Canberra is a part of the global STEM education provider, e² Young Engineers that has been operating over 50 countries since 2008. We specialise in providing innovative STEM programs to school-aged children. Our programs are designed to enrich the students’ knowledge in STEM through the use of K’nex<sup>&reg;</sup>, LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> bricks, electronics, coding and robotics techniques making it possible for the students to understand and solve a problem by practical application of theoretical concepts. We follow an inquiry-based pedagogical learning philosophy which allow children to work with project-based and problem-based lessons.</p>
	<br><p>Young Engineers Canberra mainly delivers our programs through school incursions, after-school clubs, holiday camps and other specialised programs. We proactively collaborate with universities, industry associations and other STEM providers to ensure our programs are relevant and leading-edge.</p>
	<br><p>Our vision is to create the next generation of creators, innovators, and problem solvers. We aim to make a tangible difference to the children of today by giving them 21st century skills for a lifetime of success.</p>
	<br><p>Currently we operate in 18 primary schools with our regular after-school STEM program during the school terms in the ACT and Queanbeyan area. Since the inception of our Young Engineers franchise in 2019 in the ACT, we have served over 3000 students across different programs. Furthermore, our company have also received government grants to promote STEM education in the underprivileged community sectors in the ACT. Whilst the global pandemic decelerated our expansion strategy for a period of time in year 2021, with our focus on learning, adapting and reinventing, we have been able to rise to the occasion in these challenging circumstances and steering our way back to our mission of making our STEM programs available to every primary and secondary school student in the ACT.</p>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<br><p>The project proposal outlines a comprehensive plan of action, timelines and budget to achieve the set-out deliverables. It should be noted that the timelines are subject to approval of the project from the CDSCC. The budget had been complied with the assumption that we will partner with other stakeholders for the purpose of manufacturing parts of the replica. In addition, provisions have been made in the event of adding other advance functionalities to the rover. The education program will be conducted by the Young Engineers Canberra in coordination with the CDSCC. The extent of marketing and public relations campaign will be decided based on the budget approval and further recommendations from CDSCC.</p>
	<br><p>As the next step of this proposal, we await for the CDSCC to revert to us with their feedback and recommendation and if required would be happy to organize to discuss further.</p>
	<p>We hope that we've provided sufficient information for you review.<br>We are eagerly awaiting your reply</p>
