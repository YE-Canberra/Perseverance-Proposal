    <!-- Executive Summary -->

    <!-- About Us -->
	<p>Young Engineers-Canberra is a part of the global STEM education provider, e² Young Engineers that has been operating over 50 countries since 2008. We specialise in providing innovative STEM programs to school-aged children. Our programs are designed to enrich the students’ knowledge in STEM through the use of K’nex®, LEGO® bricks, electronics, coding and robotics techniques making it possible for the students to understand and solve a problem by practical application of theoretical concepts. We follow an inquiry-based pedagogical learning philosophy which allow children to work with project-based and problem-based lessons.</p>
	<p>Young Engineers-Canberra mainly delivers our programs through school incursions, after-school clubs, holiday camps and other specialised programs. We proactively collaborate with universities, industry associations and other STEM providers to ensure our programs are relevant and leading-edge.</p>
	<p>Our vision is to create the next generation of creators, innovators, and problem solvers. We aim to make a tangible difference to the children of today by giving them 21st century skills for a lifetime of success.</p>
	<p>Currently we operate in 18 primary schools with our regular after-school STEM program during the school terms in the ACT and Queanbeyan area. Since the inception of our Young Engineers franchise in 2019 in the ACT, we have served over 3000 students across different programs. Furthermore, our company have also received government grants to promote STEM education in the underprivileged community sectors in the ACT. Whist the global pandemic decelerated our expansion strategy for a period of time in year 2021, with our focus on learning, adapting and reinventing, we have been able to rise to the occasion in these challenging circumstances and steering our way back to our mission of making our STEM programs available to every primary and secondary school student in the ACT.</p>

    <!-- Project Outline -->
	<h2>Project Title:<br>Replica of Mars Perseverance Rover</h2>

	<h2>Scope</h2>
	    <p>Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) will appoint Young Engineers-Canberra (YE CBR) to manage the project of building a replica of the Mars Perseverance Rover to be displayed at the CDSCC. YE CBR plan to deliver an education program around the construction of the robot, to a selected group of high school students in the ACT. This program will be designed to educate the students on space exploration, aeronautics, design process, challenges and robotics aspects of the Mars Perseverance Rover while in real-time assembling the rover together over a period of time. In addition, our company will provide assistance in managing the advertising, marketing and public relations of the project to create awareness and promote the project to the school communities and public.</p>
